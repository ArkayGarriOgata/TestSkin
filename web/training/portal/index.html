<h2 id="quickStart">Quick Start</h2>
<p>Below is a short video that demonstrates logging into the <a href="http://arkayportal.arkay.com">
ArkayPortal.com</a>, doing a "Search by Product Code" and some other features. </p>

<p>The characters that you type in the Search... field are used as a "contains" criteria when you press the &lt;Return&gt; key. 
  For example, typing 1113 &#9166; would 
list any product codes which contain the numbers 1113 anywhere in its name; likewise, typing 2efp&#9166; would find
any product codes with the characters 2efp or 2EFP, it is not case sensitive. The "Search by Product Line" and "Search by Description" work in the same way. </p>

<p>When you click the menu option 
  for "Can Ship" a listing of all product codes that have available inventory will be displayed without the need of entering
  any criteria.
</p>

<p>Clicking on a row in the listing will display more details about that item, such as the packing specifications and open job production. 
  A "Call Off" button will also appear that will prepare an email message that you may complete then send to Arkay's Customer Support team.
</p>

<p>Clicking on a column title in the listing will sort by that column, clicking it a second time will change the sort order to descending.</p>

<p>When you hover over a column title a menu icon will appear. Clicking on that menu icon will open a "filter" popup where you can refine what
 is displayed in the list. Options exist for Contains, Not Contains, Equals, Not Equals, Starts with, and Ends with based on what you enter in 
 the "Filter..." field. You will also be able combine that filter with a second filter using "AND" or "OR". You may also do this on multiple columns.
